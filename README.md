Arxivision is a Vulkan-based engine designed as a personal playground for exploring computer graphics. It currently focuses on rendering rasterized voxels, with future plans to incorporate cellular automata for terrain generation using voxels. The project aims to achieve visually appealing graphics and optimize performance, while documenting the process to inspire and assist others.
